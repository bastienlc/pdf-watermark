# pdf-watermark

A python CLI tool to add watermarks to a PDF. Allows for processing whole directories while keeping the directory structure.

## Description

There are multiple similar tools out there but I couldn't find one that really suited my needs. This project also serves as an excuse to play with building and distributing a python CLI tool.

With this tool you can add a watermark to a PDF file. The watermark can either be a text string that you provide, or an image (PNG being the recommanded format).

This tool provides two commands.
* **insert**: The watermark is placed once on each page at a specific position.
* **grid**: The watermark is repeated multiple times on each page in a grid pattern.

Below is an example of a PDF before using this tool, after using this tool with the *grid* command and a text watermark, and after using this tool with the *grid* command and an image watermark.

Many options are available to customize the watermark, such as the position, the opacity, the angle, the color, the font, the size, etc. A detailed list of options is available below.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* This project was built with python 3.11. However it should also run just fine with older versions.
* See `requirements.txt` for the list of dependencies.
* Some options require parts of the `poppler` library to be installed (--save-as-image and --unselectable). Please refer to the [pdf2image](https://pypi.org/project/pdf2image/) or [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) documentation for installation instructions.

### Installing

This package is available on PyPi.

```
pip install pdf-watermark
```

### Usage

**TLDR**
```bash
watermark grid input.pdf "watermark text" -s output.pdf # Grid pattern for a single file
watermark insert input_folder "watermark_image.png" # Insert image for a whole directory, overwriting the input files
```

**Detailed usage**
```
Usage: watermark [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Add a watermark to one or more PDF files.

  The watermark can be repeated in a grid pattern using the grid command, or
  inserted at a specific position using the insert command.

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  grid    Add a watermark in a grid pattern.
  insert  Add a watermark at a specific position.
```

**insert** command:
```
Usage: watermark insert [OPTIONS] FILE WATERMARK

  Add a watermark at a specific position.

  Add a WATERMARK to one or more PDF files referenced by FILE. WATERMARK can
  be either a string or a path to an image file. FILE can be a single file or
  a directory, in which case all PDF files in the directory will be
  watermarked.

Options:
  -y, --y FLOAT                   Position of the watermark with respect to
                                  the vertical direction. Must be between 0
                                  and 1.
  -x, --x FLOAT                   Position of the watermark with respect to
                                  the horizontal direction. Must be between 0
                                  and 1.
  -ha, --horizontal-alignment TEXT
                                  Alignment of the watermark with respect to
                                  the horizontal direction. Can be one of
                                  'left', 'right' and 'center'.
  -s, --save TEXT                 File or folder to save results to. By
                                  default, the input files are overwritten.
  -o, --opacity FLOAT             Watermark opacity between 0 (invisible) and
                                  1 (no transparency).
  -a, --angle FLOAT               Watermark inclination in degrees.
  -tc, --text-color TEXT          Text color in hexadecimal format, e.g.
                                  #000000.
  -tf, --text-font TEXT           Text font to use. Supported fonts are those
                                  supported by reportlab.
  -ts, --text-size INTEGER        Text font size.
  --unselectable                  Make the watermark text unselectable. This
                                  works by drawing the text as an image, and
                                  thus results in a larger file size.
  -is, --image-scale FLOAT        Scale factor for the image. Note that before
                                  this factor is applied, the image is already
                                  scaled down to fit in the boxes.
  --save-as-image                 Convert each PDF page to an image. This
                                  makes removing the watermark more difficult
                                  but also increases the file size.
  --dpi INTEGER                   DPI to use when saving the PDF as an image.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

**grid** command:
```
Usage: watermark grid [OPTIONS] FILE WATERMARK

  Add a watermark in a grid pattern.

  Add a WATERMARK to one or more PDF files referenced by FILE. WATERMARK can
  be either a string or a path to an image file. FILE can be a single file or
  a directory, in which case all PDF files in the directory will be
  watermarked.

Options:
  -h, --horizontal-boxes INTEGER  Number of repetitions of the watermark along
                                  the horizontal direction.
  -v, --vertical-boxes INTEGER    Number of repetitions of the watermark along
                                  the vertical direction.
  -m, --margin                    Wether to leave a margin around the page or
                                  not. When False (default), the watermark
                                  will be cut on the PDF edges.
  -s, --save TEXT                 File or folder to save results to. By
                                  default, the input files are overwritten.
  -o, --opacity FLOAT             Watermark opacity between 0 (invisible) and
                                  1 (no transparency).
  -a, --angle FLOAT               Watermark inclination in degrees.
  -tc, --text-color TEXT          Text color in hexadecimal format, e.g.
                                  #000000.
  -tf, --text-font TEXT           Text font to use. Supported fonts are those
                                  supported by reportlab.
  -ts, --text-size INTEGER        Text font size.
  --unselectable                  Make the watermark text unselectable. This
                                  works by drawing the text as an image, and
                                  thus results in a larger file size.
  -is, --image-scale FLOAT        Scale factor for the image. Note that before
                                  this factor is applied, the image is already
                                  scaled down to fit in the boxes.
  --save-as-image                 Convert each PDF page to an image. This
                                  makes removing the watermark more difficult
                                  but also increases the file size.
  --dpi INTEGER                   DPI to use when saving the PDF as an image.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
